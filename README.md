 Hi there , I'm Nabeeh Abu Ali! ðŸ‘‹
 
I'm a Flutter developer currently working at Integrated Technology Group (ITG) in Amman, Jordan. I'm passionate about building beautiful and functional mobile applications. I bring 2 years of experience using Flutter to create user-centric experiences. 

I hold a Computer Science degree from the University of Jordan, which equipped me with a strong foundation in programming concepts and problem-solving skills.







I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or interesting projects in mind!
