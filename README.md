I'm a Flutter developer currently working at Integrated Technology Group (ITG) in Amman, Jordan. I'm passionate about building beautiful and functional mobile applications. I bring 2 years of experience using Flutter to create user-centric experiences. 

I hold a Computer Science degree from the University of Jordan, which equipped me with a strong foundation in programming concepts and problem-solving skills.







I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or interesting projects in mind!

Happy coding! ðŸ˜ŠðŸš€
